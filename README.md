## Quick Start

The code was tested with Python 3.6. To use this code, please do:

1. Clone the repo:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/oreopie/physics-aware-dl.git
   cd physics-aware-dl
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib pandas
   ```

3. Start `Jupyter Notebook` and run the `demo_single_model` locally.
